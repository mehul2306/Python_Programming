The Romans represented numbers using the numerals ``I``, ``V``, ``X``, ``L``, ``C``, ``D``, and ``M``. These numerals represent the following numbers:

|Roman Numeral	|Hindu-Arabic Equivalent|
|:---|:---|
|I	|1|
|V	|5|
|X	|10|
|L	|50|
|C	|100|
|D	|500|
|M	|1000|


For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are basic rules which must be followed. 
1. Repeating a numeral up to three times represents addition of the number. For example, III represents 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. 
2. Only I, X, C, and M can be repeated; V, L, and D cannot be, and there is no need to do so.
3. Writing numerals that decrease from left to right represents addition of the numbers. For example, LX represents 50 + 10 = 60 and XVI represents 10 + 5 + 1 = 16.
4. To write a number that otherwise would take repeating of a numeral four or more times, there is a subtraction rule. 
5. Writing a smaller numeral to the left of a larger numeral represents subtraction. For example, IV represents 5 - 1 = 4 and IX represents 10 - 1 = 9. To avoid ambiguity, the only pairs of numerals that use this subtraction rule are

|Roman Numeral	|Hindu-Arabic Equivalent|
|:---------------|:-----------------------|
|IV	|4 = 5 - 1|
|IX	|9 = 10 - 1|
|XL	|40 = 50 - 10|
|XC	|90 = 100 - 10|
|CD	|400 = 500 - 100|
|CM	|900 = 1000 - 100|

Even though the rules allow some numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a "best" way of writing a particular number.

For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the number sixteen:
```
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI
```
However, according to the rules, only ``XIIIIII`` and ``XVI`` are valid, and the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.

In this project, you will read a roman numeral from the user. First, you need to check if the number if in a valid form according to the rules posted above. Then convert it to the minimal representation. It's essential to modularize your code, and you are free to use either for or while loop. You are not allowed to use any of the Python structures that are not taught so far.
